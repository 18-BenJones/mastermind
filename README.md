# Project 1 - Mastermind
a simple version of the game mastermind built using the GODOT engine

### How to play:
The game will generate a random sequance of 4 colours unknown to the player, 
and the player must guess what colours are in the sequence. If The colour you placed in 
a specific row is correct, then it will show a white indicator. If the colour is in the 
sequence but not in that position, a red indicator will show. If the colour is not in the 
sequence, or there isn't another of the same colour in the sequence, no indicator will show.
